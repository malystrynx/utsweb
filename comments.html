                <br>
                <br>
                <p>For every section of the website, I used the body, main and then div as its structure. I have also used padding and line-height so that they website doesn't look squished together.
                    <br>
                     Let's start off with the <span class="classes">index.html</span>.
                     On the <span class="green">Header</span> I made the title of "Web Systems Assignment" and also the navigation section which included; "Home", "Past", "Future" and "Comments". The navigation section were made with unordered lists and lists. Inside the lists I put in the a tags and also href so I would be able to link the navigation bar.</p>
                     <br>
                     On the <span class="blue">Main</span> section, I put all my information there for the readers to read. I mainly used &lt;div&gt; tags to section and also edit my work with CSS after putting classes on my divs. The tags I have included in the main section of this assignment were heading tags (&lt;h2&gt;, &lt;h3&gt;, &lt;h4&gt;), paragraphs (&lt;p&gt;), lists (&lt;ul&gt;, &lt;li&gt;) and images (&lt;img&gt;). These were the basic layouts on all the sections for this website although some additions can be seen on the Home and Past section.
                     <br>
                     <p>For the Home section,&lt;ul&gt; and &lt;li&gt; tags were used to show the readers what additional subjects I was taking this semester for uni. When clicked, the links would take them to another tab instead of the page they were on by using the target ="_blank" attribute. </p>
                     <p>On the Past section, I have created a little timeline by creating a few &lt;div&gt; tags and having the year, school/ work, and a small description about it. I then created a small line on the side with 'border-left: 2px solid' to create a long line down on the left hand side to make it look like a timeline going down. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Finally for the <span class="red">Footer</span> I made a simple look with just using one &lt;p&gt; tag and using a &lt;div&gt; before it with a class called 'footer__desc'. This was to change the color to black and notify the reader that it was the end of the page. Included inside it was my name, my university and also my student ID. </p>
                    </p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="comments__layout">Aesthetics</h2>
                <p>For me, I have chosen a simple design for this website as I did not want an explosion of colors for the people that view my website. I decided to go for a minimalistic look with only using 2 main colors throughout this website.</p>
                <br>
                <h3 class="royalblue">Colors</h3>
In my thought process, I decided to have a background image for my website, unfortunately it was hard for me to find a good color for my texts and seemed like it was taking over the website with how many colors there were. I then decided to make the background black and have the text white, but the colors felt too sharp for my eyes. Lastly I decided to use a beige like color and a lighter shade of black for my website so that It would be pleasing to the eyes.
<br>
<br>
<h3 class="purple">Font</h3>
<p>I have used a few different font sizes in this website to signify that they are either a title, a new topic or a new paragraph. For the font style, I used 'Rubik' as its text looks 'nicely flowing' for this website. For users that might not have access to the font, I have also put in 'sans-serif' as a backup font. For me a well chosen font is as important as color when it comes to designing a website. If I had chosen 'Times New Romans' as my font, It would look like my website was made in the early 2000's and would not fit in my aesthetics of this website.  </p>
<br>
<h3 class="red">Interaction</h3>
<p>For the Interaction aspect in this website, I have made a few links where users can click on. One of them is in the 'Home' page. The subjects that I have stated can also be clicked and it can take you into another page. The navigation bar is also another interaction that users can click on. When they hover over these options, an underline will appear, signifying that it is something you can click on. </p>
<br>
<h2 class="comments__layout">Accessibility</h2>
<p>When it comes to accessibility, I want people with disabilities to have the same equal access everyone else has. </p>
<p>
    When it comes to font sizing, I have made it so that when people zoom in, the font would also become larger, making it easier for those that have impaired vision to read better. I have also put spacing for the words with 'line-height' so they do not look like they are all stuck together. For the images, I have put an 'alt' attribute so those that have vision impairment are able to visualize the image by the text. Different font sizes used can also help those distinguish which part they are reading.
