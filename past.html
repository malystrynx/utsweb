                <p>Here is a bit about my past with my education and work experience. I have also learnt a bit of HTML, CSS and JavaScript during covid as I wanted to understand the basics of coding. Unfortunately I didn't have any IT experience during High School as I took the SAT instead of HSC, so I am not able to provide any details for that, however I have made a timeline for myself. </p>
