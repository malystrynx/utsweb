Experience with websites

I have self-taught myself how to code in basic html and CSS and a bit of JavaScript for a year. I enjoy the designing aspect of web development and still currently learning JavaScript. I have learnt a few frameworks like react, which can accelerate my coding.

Future

This is my plans in the future

Currently, my goal is to finish uni and find internships. I want to create more websites so that I would be able to get experience in writing clean and reusable code. With a good portfolio I will be able to land an internship where I can learn how I can use my skills in the workforce. I am aiming to become a web developer as I like the designing aspect when it comes to coding.
