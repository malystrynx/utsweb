                <p>This is what I plan to achieve in the future </p>
                
                <p>Currently, my goal is to complete my university course and find internships. I want to create more websites so that I would be able to get experience in writing clean and reusable code. With a good portfolio I will be able to land an internship where I can learn how I can use my skills in the workforce. I am aiming to become a web developer as I like the designing aspect when it comes to coding. </p>
<p>Another goal that I hope to achieve in the future is the running of my family's business. I hope that we are able to be able to distribute our frozen goods across all of Australia and open up multiple restaurants around New South Wales.</p>
